todo

[x] player can move between screens
[x] storing multiple screens
[x] multi-screen level editor
[x] room titles
[x] count total number of undelivered letters
[x] special NPC who gives you the letters

[x] load different NPCs on each level
[x] win condition - party host dialogue changes - message changes to 'go home'
[x] fix jumping - something with yval - you can get extra height or less height 

[x] title screen with credits (including the font)
[x] fix saving and loading and editing

[ ] add the second set of areas, the train and the otherlands
[ ] shave off the edge of the screen
[ ] the controls are a bit awkward

[ ] music
[ ] more screens, like 10x10
[ ] title screen dithered snail image https://29a.ch/ditherlicious/

[ ] sound effects
[ ] environmental hazards (implies: losing \ reloading)
    maybe we can have button \ gate \ timing puzzles with no death.



low priority:
[ ] special start-screen NPCs you can greet before you get the letters
[ ] make it so the player can align into 1-block gaps

ideas:
people look at you, except one person who looks away

oh, they're having a party? i wish YOU were having a party
